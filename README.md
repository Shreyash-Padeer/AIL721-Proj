 # Demand Forecasting for Supply Chain Systems

 Effective inventory management is crucial for retail businesses to optimize operations, minimize costs, and
 meet customer demand. This project leverages Machine Learning and Deep Learning to forecast product
 demand in a retail environment, using a rich dataset containing transactional, product, and contextual
 information. The objective is to build and evaluate a predictive model that can accurately forecast demand,
 enabling better inventory planning and decision-making.
