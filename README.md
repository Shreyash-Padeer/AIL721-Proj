 # Demand Forecasting for Supply Chain Systems

 Effective inventory management is crucial for retail businesses to optimize operations, minimize costs, and
 meet customer demand. This project leverages Machine Learning and Deep Learning to forecast product
 demand in a retail environment, using a rich dataset containing transactional, product, and contextual
 information. The objective is to build and evaluate a predictive model that can accurately forecast demand,
 enabling better inventory planning and decision-making.

# Aim 
To use deep learning models for the prediction of time-series data and compare the results to the traditional ML models

# Why Use Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting?
Unlike traditional statistical methods, deep learning doesn’t require explicit programming to recognize patterns. Instead, it learns these patterns directly from the data, making it particularly adept at handling the intricacies of time series data.
One of the key strengths of deep learning is its ability to process vast amounts of data and learn from features that may not be immediately apparent.
Deep learning models, especially those employing neural networks, excel in identifying subtle, complex patterns and relationships that are often missed by traditional methods.

Furthermore, deep learning’s flexibility allows it to adapt to a wide range of time series forecasting tasks. From predicting stock market trends to forecasting weather patterns, deep learning models can be tailored to suit the specific needs of different domains. This adaptability stems from the various architectures available within deep learning, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), each offering unique advantages for processing sequential data.
